## Hey there! 👋
I'm Jadon, an aspiring software engineer with interests in app development and machine learning.  

My journey began at an early age by learning Lua to create video games using Roblox Studio. I have branched out since then to full-stack apps and machine learning models.

I can work full-stack, but I prefer working on the backend. Whenever I do work on the frontend or UI, I like creating minimalistic designs inspired by Apple — I love attention to detail. 

## Skills
- C#, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Lua, HTML, CSS, SQL
- Node.js, React Native, Blazor, .NET Framework, MySQL
- Visual Studio, Git, Jupyter Notebook, Repl.it

## About Myself
- 🎮 I love to play video games, chess, table tennis, golf at the range, and bowl  
- 🌊 I like snowboarding, wakeboarding, jet skiing, and surfing (anything on water basically)  
- ⚾️ I enjoy watching baseball — go Dodgers!
- 🧰 I'm passionate about building software tools that make tedious tasks look simple
